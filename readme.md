# Weather web App

This Weather App project was developed during my internship at Bharat Intern. It is a web application that allows users to search for weather updates based on city, country, or state names. The app boasts several features that enhance user experience and make accessing weather information a breeze.

## Features

- <h2>Search by Location:</h2>  Users can search for weather updates by entering the name of a city, country, or state. This feature provides accurate and relevant weather data for the desired location.
- <h2>Responsive Design:</h2>  The app is built with HTML and utilizes the Tailwind CSS framework for styling. This ensures that the app is fully responsive, enabling users to access weather updates on any device or screen size.
- <h2>No Result Indicator:</h2>  In case a search query does not generate any weather information, the app displays a user-friendly message indicating that there are no results available for that particular location. This helps users quickly understand the situation and adapt to the available weather data.
- <h2>Loading Indicator:</h2>  To provide a smooth user experience, the app incorporates a loading indicator that visually notifies users when weather data is being fetched. This indicator assures users that the app is actively working to retrieve the requested information.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript: Used to handle the logic for tracking the speed and updating the UI.
- HTML: Markup language for structuring the web page.
- Tailwind CSS: Styling language for designing the user interface.

## Usage

To use the Weather App, simply open the HTML file in a web browser, and the app will load. Enter the desired city, country, or state name in the search bar, and hit enter or click the search button. The app will retrieve and display the weather information for the specified location.
